A simple Instagram clone with its basic functionalities (liking, posting, commenting, editing profile). The main goal with this project was learning how to challenge myself when it comes to SQL/DB skills, creating a performance-driven Backend that quickly answers to the web requests.

Stacks used:
 - Next JS / React (Frontend)
 - Express JS / Node JS (Backend)
 - PlanetScale (SQL)
 - Cloudinary (photo database)
